# Pd Patch for Antonio Russek's "Summermood"

This repository contains Pd code for playing Antonio Russek's "Summermood," originally written for bass flute and delay (DeltaLab DL-4).
This patch emulates the core functionality of the DL-4 and contains presets based on the score and a recording of the performance.

The main patch structure is based on Miller Puckette's "Null Piece," with plans to preserve a definitive version of the piece using Puckette's
"Reality Check" CI framework for electroacoustic music preservation and Pd regression testing.
